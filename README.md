It only kicks on when the environment is actually dark.</li><li data-list="bullet"><strong>Touch Dimming:</strong> The TTP223 sensor is more than just an on/off switch. By long-pressing the sensor, you can adjust the brightness via PWM, allowing you to save battery or set a mood.</li><li data-list="bullet"><strong>Soft-Off (Grace Period):</strong> Sensitive touch sensors often cause accidental blackouts. To prevent this, when you tap to turn the lamp off, it blinks and waits 5 seconds before cutting the power. If you touch the sensor again during this countdown, the shutdown is canceled!</li></ol>
